## Introduction

- The aim of the project is to create an Application to ease the Healthcare workers to track the patient details and clearly have idea on the availability of the doctors to make an appointments. This application will help in reducing the manual work of the healthcare workers, patients. This web portal also helps in maintaining the patient record so that
doctors can easily handle the patients according to their history.

- The application is developed using Front end technologies HTML5, CSS3 and Java Framework JSP. Coming to Backend technologies we have used Servlets and Database as
MySQL connected using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) framework. The application aims to make the requesting doctorâ€™s appointment process more efficient and easier to
handle.

- The primary goal of creating this system is to diminish the repetitive manual work at Health focus counters. Every kind of task is performed by the system, such as registering
different types of actors (i.e. doctors, patients and others), appointment booking, and history check etc. Doctors and the patients can access the application with the help of the
URL which redirect to the web page. A patient can use the web application to choose a doctor to make appointments with.
