## Introduction

- The aim of the project is to create an Application to ease the Healthcare workers to track the patient details and clearly have idea on the availability of the doctors to make an appointments. This application will help in reducing the manual work of the healthcare workers, patients. This web portal also helps in maintaining the patient record so that
doctors can easily handle the patients according to their history.

- The application is developed using Front end technologies HTML5, CSS3 and Java Framework JSP. Coming to Backend technologies we have used Servlets and Database as
MySQL connected using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) framework. The application aims to make the requesting doctor’s appointment process more efficient and easier to
handle.

- The primary goal of creating this system is to diminish the repetitive manual work at Health focus counters. Every kind of task is performed by the system, such as registering
different types of actors (i.e. doctors, patients and others), appointment booking, and history check etc. Doctors and the patients can access the application with the help of the
URL which redirect to the web page. A patient can use the web application to choose a doctor to make appointments with. 

## Overview

- To create the web application for the Healthcare Management system, first doctor and patient registration details were taken into considered. There are number of
hospitals which are currently have manual system which have more repetitive and laborious work and also error prone to computerize the same for quicker efficient results
and customer satisfaction. This application will ease healthcare scenario.

- Faster and online processing of the Healthcare System would mean better service to the patients. It would also help in the major complexity of maintaining the records manually
and thus very less time is wasted on iterative work. Proper maintenance of the patient information and ability to schedule appointment with doctor or lab is key feature of this
system. Towards this achievement the computerization of the Healthcare system will help greatly in maintaining proper information.

- As current manual system is slow repetitive and error prone to computerize the same for quicker efficient results, online healthcare management system is the correct solution
for that.

- This application is useful in various ways as the information about doctor’s availability and online appointment booking with doctor. Patient and doctor, both can view
patient history for reference. Also, all the information about the patients and doctors are maintained in the database.
